This project is based on superstore's marketing campaign with data from Kaggle[^1]. Its aim is to showcase my data analytics skills by building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of customers responding positively to a year-end sales campaign.

  **Context:** A superstore is planning for the year-end sale. They want to launch a new offer - gold membership, that gives a 20% discount on all purchases, for only $499 which is $999 on other days. It will be valid only for existing customers and the campaign through phone calls is currently being planned for them. The management feels that the best way to reduce the cost of the campaign is to make a predictive model which will classify customers who might purchase the offer.

  **Objective:** The superstore wants to predict the likelihood of the customer giving a positive response and wants to identify the different factors which affect the customer's response. You need to analyze the data provided to identify these factors and then build a prediction model to predict the probability of a customer will give a positive response.

### Steps:

**1. Data preprocessing:** Handle missing values, duplicates and outliers, encode categorical variables and transform date features.

**2. Data analysis on customer segments:** Establish customer segments, analyze customer behavior, total sales per customer by segment

**3. A/B tests**

**3. Model builidng:** Data reduction, implementation of a logistic regression and random forest model, model evaluation
